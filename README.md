# Dockerized Applications

This is my personal repository for useful dockerized applications that I may need to have in a click of a button.

** This is strictly for development purposes only, and is not secure to use in a production environment.*

## Currently supported applications

* Databases
    * MySQL
    * Redis
    * Postgres

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dimosthenisk/dockerized-applications
$ chown 1001 ./databases/redis/redisdata
```
